NAME
    Toadfarm - One Mojolicious app to rule them all

SYNOPSIS
  Production
    You can start the application by running:

      $ toadfarm myconfig.conf;

    "myconfig.conf" should contain a list with the application you want to
    run and a set of HTTP headers to act on. Example:

      {
        apps => [
          'My::App' => {
            'X-Request-Base' => 'http://mydomain.com/whatever',
          },
          'My::Other::App' => {
            'Host' => 'mydomain.com',
          },
        ],
      }

    The config above will run "My::App" when the "X-Request-Base" header is
    set to "http://mydomain.com/whatever".

    Or it will pass the request on to "My::Other::App" if the "Host" header
    is set to "mydomain.com".

    NOTE: "X-Request-Base" is a special header: Normally the route object
    will be attached to the route object of the Toadfarm route object. This
    does not happen with the "X-Request-Base" header.

    NOTE: The apps are processed in the order they are defined. This means
    that the first app that match will be executed.

  Debug
    It is possible to start the server in foreground as well:

      $ MOJO_CONFIG=myconfig.conf toadfarm prefork
      $ MOJO_CONFIG=myconfig.conf toadfarm daemon

    See other options by running:

      $ toadfarm -h

DESCRIPTION
    This application can be used to load other Mojolicious apps inside one
    app. This could be useful if you want to save memory or instances on
    dotcloud or heroku.
