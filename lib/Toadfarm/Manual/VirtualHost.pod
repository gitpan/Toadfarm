=head1 NAME

Toadfarm::Manual::VirtualHost - Virtual host setup

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an alternative to using C<nginx> (or another web server) in front
as virtual host router.

This is especially useful if already have a CDN (like L<http://cloudflare.com>)
in front.

=head2 Config

The magic part here is the "Host" HTTP header which is sent by the browser,
and will route to the correct application.

  {
    apps => [
      '/home/www/project1/script/app1' => {
        Host => 'app1.mydomain.com',
      },
      '/home/www/project2/script/app2' => {
        Host => 'app2.mydomain.com',
      },
    ],
    hypnotoad => {
      workers => 8,
      pid_file => '/tmp/toadfarm.pid',
      listen => [
        "http://*:8080",
      ],
    },
  };

Note: Defining a default app might be an idea, in case the a browser doesn't
set the "Host" header.
